# Business-Sales-Analysis-MATLAB

This project is made to analyse the data of a large dataset and visualize that in a bar graphs ,line graphs ,histogram , piechart.
From these plots we can able to answer the of HOW , WHY , WHEN , WHERE questions that arises.
Specifically the questions of 'Where the revenue comes from?' , 'When did the things happen?' , 'How the sales are distributed?';
This project especially focuses on understanding patterns and not predictions as this is a beginner-level project.

## Dataset
-- File: sales_data_sample.csv
-- It is attached within the repository
-- Contains transaction-level sales records with date, product line, country, and deal size information which is huge enough to analyse as a whole set

## Analysis Performed

-- Sales by Product Line (Bar Chart) 
    -- This is to identify which categories performs the best
    -- This helps in business planning ,marketing and investment decisions
    -- Bar charts are used to compare discrete quantities or qualities 

-- Monthly Sale Trends (Line Graph)
    -- Sales data change over time
    -- This helps in identifying seasonal demands
    -- Forcasted planning and also helps in which season which promotion kicks
    -- Line Graph are used for time based thing shows clear increase and decrease and when those perks happened

-- Top 5 Countries by Sale (Bar Chart)
    -- This shows in which countries their business is going well
    -- Helps in ensuring which set of population needs their product (in this project) needs the most 
    -- It may be product or services depending on the project
    -- Thus ensuring which things they have to alter to make their business well in less business scaled countries

-- Sales by Deal Size (Pie chart)
    -- It shows order value segments
    -- It helps with pricing strategies which is below priced, over - priced and those irregularities can be identified
    -- Pie charts are used to show proportional contribution

-- Sales Contribution(Histogram)
    -- It shows frequency of values 
    -- Common sales range can be identified 
    -- The most one would be with more people would have opted for
    -- This shows the continuous plot of thing

-- Quantity vs Sales(Scatter Plot)
    -- Helps to observe whether there is any relationship between the two 
    -- To examine Is higher the quantity , Higher is the sales so and so 

## Tools Used

-- Matlab(Basics)
-- Data Visualization
-- Data Analytics

## Visual Results

-- It is attached in the same repository
-- The MATLAB code is also attached within the repository

## Key Insights

-- Certain product lines generate higher revenue.
-- Sales show seasonal trends across months.
-- Medium and large deals contribute most of the revenue.
